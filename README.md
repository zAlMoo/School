Repo where me and my class will put all files of the 2018-2019 address' subjects lessons.

### General Infos
We will put the files divided in folders, renamed by the dates of the works.
Inside these folders there will be the files and a small .txt file, where I'll put textually what we've done.

**Note**: all the dates are expressed in the DD/MM/YYYY format.

### Repo clonation

    $ sudo apt-get install git
    $ git clone github.com/iDoppioclick/3ID-ICT.git
