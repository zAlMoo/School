Repo where me and my class will put all files of the 2018-2019 address' subjects lessons.

### General Infos
We will put the files divided in folders, renamed by the dates of the works.
Inside these folders there will be the files and a small .txt file, where I'll put textually what we've done.

**Note**: all the dates are expressed in the DD/MM/YYYY format, and are expressed as the deadline of the homework.

### Repo clonation
If (for some akward reasons) you want to clone the repo on your server, You just only have to do these commands:

    $ sudo apt-get install git
    $ git clone github.com/iDoppioclick/School.git
    $ cd School
    
To update the repo with the new files, just run this simple command:
